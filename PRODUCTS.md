### E1525 (Motion sensor)

Details:

* Battery: 2x CR2032

Pinout (unverified):

* Time selection dial (R13): PA1 (Looks like a potentiometer between R12 high side and a FET to GND enabled directly by PB14.)
* Day/night selection dial (R15): PB15 (Dito, with resistor R14 and same transistor.)
* Pairing button (S1): Silicone rubber button puling PA0 directly to GND

* The motion detection dome is connected (one pin directly, one indirectly) to an "E93196C 5090C 9A" labelled 8-pin chip to which also PC10 and PB14 are connected (needs further investigation).

* Various test points:
  * VCC: `TP8_1`, `TP8_2`
  * GND: `TP2_1`, `TP3_2`
  * PB13: `TP2_2`
  * PA0: `TP4_1`, `TP4_2`
  * PA1: `TP5_2`

The module is easy to take apart, and debug wires can be soldered on without separating the radio / MCU PCB from the carrier PCB. The carrier board is labelled "D-Sensor-A1-01-A-V2.0".

### E1526 (Gateway)

Details:

* Power supply: USB 5V 1A

Pinout: 

* A0  - LED ON     - TP7
* A1  - BTN        - TP6
* B11 - FLASH CS
* B12 - GYRO INT
* B13 - FLASH VCC
* B14 - ACC INT    - TP8
* B15 - GYRO ON    - TP9
* C10 - I2C SDA
* C11 - I2C SCL
* D13 - FLASH MCLK
* D14 - FLASH MISO
* D15 - FLASH MOSI
* F0  - SWCLK      - TP1
* F1  - SWDIO      - TP2
* F2  - SWO        - TP3
* F3  - DBG        - TP4
*       RESET      - TP5

### ICPSLC24-10NA (LED output controller/dimmer)

Details:

* Potted: no

The output appears to be measured by the module somehow.
Detailed PCB investigation required.

TRÅDFRI Module pinout (incomplete/unverified):

* PA0: K1 (Reset key)
* PA1: Goes to ZD1, through R9 and then to OUT+, possibly output measuring?
* PB13: Pulls down the FET Gate
* PF0: Pin 2 on header
* PF1: Pin 3 on header

### ICPSHC24-10EU-IL-1 (10W LED driver/dimmer)

10 Watt Power supply with the 24 V output being controlled by ICPSLC24-10NA

### ICPSHC24-30EU-IL-1 (30W LED driver/dimmer)

30 Watt Power supply with the 24 V output being controlled by ICPSLC24-10NA

### L1529 (FLOALT 60x60)

Details:

* Potted: no

TRÅDFRI Module pinout (incomplete):

* PA0: Pulse (not very readable)
* PA1: PWM3 (not very readable)
* PB1: PWM2
* PB13: PWM1

### L1527 (FLOALT 30x30)

Details:

* Potted: no
* 12.5W power supply/controller: PWIC012V24P

TRÅDFRI module pinout:

* PA1: PWM for red (2200K) channel, from TIM1 CH0
* PB12: PWM for blue (4000K) channel, from TIM1 CH1
* other GPIO pads may be brought out from the module, but they're unused
